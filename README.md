A project to experiment with "react-ing all the things".

Platform targets:

- Desktop (with electron)
- Android (with react-native)
- IOS (with react-native)
- Web (with react-native-web)

## Project Goal

To have an application which supports the day to day
keeping track of stock for a small buisness.

> **A note about IOS**
>
> Even though IOS _should_ work, there is currently no
> deliberate intention to support it properly.
> IOS development requires a mac, which I lack.
